# Christmas Movie Bingo
The perfect, fun accompianment to Christmas movies on Halmark, Lifetime, or your streaming service of choice. The goal is to have fun, fill squares, and enjoy a poorly acted, predictable, but heartwarming movie. Being lenient with interpretation helps make it more fun, but if you’re filling in a half dozen squares in the first few minutes, you might be too lenient. Be patient, most of these things happen in most movies and are obvious when they do.
