# Christmas Movie Bingo
The perfect, fun accompianment to Christmas movies on Halmark, Lifetime, or your streaming service of choice. The goal is to have fun, fill squares, and enjoy a poorly acted, predictable, but heartwarming movie.

## Instructions
Download [Christmas-Movie-Bingo.pdf](https://www.github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/raw/main/Christmas-Movie-Bingo.pdf) and print enough bingo cards for everyone to have one. Then simply watch a movie together and mark off squares as the events occur in the movie. Lively debate over whether something counts is encouraged. Being lenient with interpretation helps make it more fun, but if you’re filling in a half dozen squares in the first few minutes, you might be too lenient. Be patient, most of these things happen in most movies and are obvious when they do. The first person to get five squares in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins!  

You can customize your game by downloading [SquareList.txt](https://github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/blob/main/SquareList.txt). Add, remove, and edit items in the list as you see fit. Then generate your own cards by copying the list and pasting into the "Enter Words or Numbers Here" field with this bingo card generator: https://myfreebingocards.com/bingo-card-generator.
