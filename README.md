<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/blob/main/bingo-thumbnail.png">

The perfect accompianment to cheesy Christmas movies on Halmark, Lifetime, or your streaming service of choice. The goal is to have fun with your family and friends, fill squares, and "enjoy" a predictable, but heartwarming movie.

## Instructions
Download [Christmas-Movie-Bingo-Cards.pdf](https://www.github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/raw/main/Christmas-Movie-Bingo-Cards.pdf) (or the [Low Ink Version](https://www.github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/raw/main/CM-Bingo-Cards-LoInk.pdf)) and print enough bingo cards for everyone to have their own card The pdf has 30 cards, each with a random square arrangement. Watch a movie together and mark off squares on cards as the events occur in the movie. The first person to get five squares in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins! 

Square explainations are provided below. Lively debate amongst participants about whether something counts is encouraged. Being lenient with interpretation helps make it more fun, but if you’re filling in a half dozen squares in the first few minutes, you might be too lenient. Be patient, most of these things happen in most movies and are obvious when they do.

You can customize your game by downloading [SquareList.txt](https://github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/blob/main/SquareList.txt). Add, remove, and edit items in the list as you see fit. Then generate your own cards by copying the list and pasting into the "Enter Words or Numbers Here" field with this bingo card generator: https://myfreebingocards.com/bingo-card-generator.

Topics include, but are not limited to, christmas in general, life in small towns, or the family business. For example, someone who prefers to keep busy with their work through christmas because they're just not into it (cold heart) - but later they share that they've avoided christmas since they're father passed because it was his favorite holiday (shows warmth).</dd>

  <dt>Hot Chocolate</dt>
  <dd>Someone says the words “Hot Chocolate” or someone is seen drinking hot chocolate. Children holding mugs can be assumed to be hot chocolate. Adults holding mugs can not be assumed to be hot chocolate unless there is whipped cream on top, a candy cane sticking out, or marshmallows visible.</dd>
