<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/blob/main/bingo-thumbnail.png">

The perfect accompianment to cheesy Christmas movies on Halmark, Lifetime, or your streaming service of choice. The goal is to have fun with your family and friends, fill squares, and "enjoy" a predictable, but heartwarming movie.

## Instructions
Download [Christmas-Movie-Bingo-Cards.pdf](https://www.github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/raw/main/Christmas-Movie-Bingo-Cards.pdf) (or the [Low Ink Version](https://www.github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/raw/main/CM-Bingo-Cards-LoInk.pdf)) and print enough bingo cards for everyone to have their own card The pdf has 30 cards, each with a random square arrangement. Then watch a movie together and mark off squares on cards as the events occur in the movie. The first person to get five squares in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins! 

Specific explainations for every square is provided below. Lively debate amongst participants about whether something counts is encouraged. Being lenient with interpretation helps make it more fun, but if you’re filling in a half dozen squares in the first few minutes, you might be too lenient. Be patient, most of these things happen in most movies and are obvious when they do.

You can customize your game by downloading [SquareList.txt](https://github.com/andyrew/Christmas-Movie-Bingo/blob/main/SquareList.txt). Add, remove, and edit items in the list as you see fit. Then generate your own cards by copying the list and pasting into the "Enter Words or Numbers Here" field with this bingo card generator: https://myfreebingocards.com/bingo-card-generator.
